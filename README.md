# PE Network Manager
An PE Network Manager for Windows PE by Holger Kotsch.

# Why was outdated?
When I first saw about Holger's PE Network Manager site, I immediately saw that they will plan Version 0.60, but unfortunately 0.59 Beta 13 was never released back in Late 2019.

Holger later announced in February 22, 2020 says that no new version last year, he also trying to port (again) PENM to C++. Either way, he also provided AU3 source.

## UPDATE for 2025-12-23
On December 23, 2025, Holger announced that PE Network Manager 0.59 Beta 13 is upcoming, quoted this:
> I'm working again on some stuff for PENM (Beta 13), some error fixing, extended icons for different resolutions and for a *like' dark color scheme.
> These icons were finished some years ago but never published.I'm also trying some things with importing network settings to an ini profile.
> I will be back again in a few days/weeks.
> I think I also missed a lot WWW changes over the years: Reboot.pro is not available anymore and theoven.org seems offline currently...

To tell about two sites down, Holger says that Reboot.pro and TheOven.org site was shut down due to it's offline. But they still can accessed on Internet Archive's Wayback machine to check these site.

In some circumstances, Will PE Network Manager supports Windows 11? hence the NT kernel shares Windows 10 for some reason.
