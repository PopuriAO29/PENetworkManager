# PE Network Manager
An PE Network Manager for Windows PE by Holger Kotsch.

# Why was outdated?
When I first saw about Holger's PE Network Manager site, I immediately saw that they will plan Version 0.60, but unfortunately 0.59 Beta 13 was never released back in Late 2019.

Holger later announced in February 22, 2020 says that no new version last year, he also trying to port (again) PENM to C++. Either way, he also provided AU3 source.
